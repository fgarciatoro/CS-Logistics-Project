//so we call Shift(int shiftNum) with the variable shiftNum, so we need to use that s the index for the ith availability of all the members and put that into an ArrayList<ArrayList<String memberName>> so that for each shift we know which members can take it
  
  //Then, we will parse through that double arraylist and for each shift, the people who are amrked yes get ( 1000/numPeopleWhoCanTakeThisShift ) (becuase even if like 20 people can take the shift, they'll all still get something which relatively will make it so that the one with the most points gets it, I think...) and maybe people get like 10 points or something
